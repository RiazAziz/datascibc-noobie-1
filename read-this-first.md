Before you start please read [this short guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) that describes how you might work.


## A chronological list of things I did to get this going.


- *start* by making a repository on github (either by creating or forking) as per this [recommendation](https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r/connect-rstudio-to-git-and-github.html)
- in this case I created a new repository but others could fork from this [one](https://github.com/inform-health-informatics/datascibc-noobie.git)
- this repository will _allow_ commits to the main branch without at least one review

- now log on to the data science desktop
- open RStudio
- created a new project by checking out from version control (bottom option)

- *before* you do any work, make a branch (see 'New Branch') button or follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55592824)
