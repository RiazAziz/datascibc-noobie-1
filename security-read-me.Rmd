## What Cheryl did to set up her security to safely store secret codes and keep data and key items off the internet

- Forked [inform-health-informatics/datascibc-noobie](https://github.com/inform-health-informatics/datascibc-noobie) and added to [my] (https://github.com/tagimoucia-cheryl?tab=repositories)
- Cloned repository onto my datascience desktop into directory: B:/datascibc-noobie/public-datascibc-noobie
- saved [example-config](https://github.com/tagimoucia-cheryl/datascibc-noobie-1/tree/feature/security-basics)as .Renviron in parent directory on data science desktop (B:/datascibc-noobie) by using setwd()
- I populated UDS detail with that used to access EMAP via dbForge

*What is left for me to populate:*
- ICS details
- internet access proxy address for UCL
