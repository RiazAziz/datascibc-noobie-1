                              ---- pipeline between SQL and R to allow to data analysis/ exploration in R -------

1.	In R: Make a SQL file – place the SQL code you have written for the query you want in this and safe it 

2.	Make a new R script: You will need to incorporate your R secrets/ Renviron – I use R secrets and this will explain how to do it with that
              -	Check the secrets file for how to set up a secrets file 

3.	In the R script put in the follwiong 
            -	Example : 'Core_Demo_NEWS_2021.sql'

4. 
      Install.package("RPostgres")
      library(RPostgres)
      library(tidyverse)
      getwd()
      setwd("~/EMAP_Project")
      source("secrets.R")
      ctn <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
                      	   host = host,
                     	     port = port,
                    	     user = user,
                     	     password = password,
                      	   dbname = dbname)

5.
dataframe <- dbGetQuery(ctn, 'select * from star.location')
          -	Make sure to include the relevant table you are working on 
core_demo <- dbGetQuery(ctn, readr::read_file('Core_Demo_NEWS_2021.sql'))
