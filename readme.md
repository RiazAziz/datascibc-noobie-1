## Repository to practice collaborative work using EMAP and its tool chain

By then end of this, you should 

- have a workflow that uses branching and pull requests to work on code
- have set-up your R project to safely store your secret codes and keep data and other key items off the internet
- made a connection to the main 'star' database
- pulled data to build a patient cohort
- manipulated those data
- pushed the result back to a schema on the UDS


## Security

Create a `.Renviron` file at the top level of your project using the example in `example/dotRenviron`.
Ensure that your `.gitignore` file excludes `.Renviron` and data files that might leak sensitive data. See the example in this repository.

## making connection to "star" database in EMAP 

•	This is very simple and you use the “secrets.R’  file again 

install.package("RPostgres")
library(RPostgres)
source("secrets.R")
ctn <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres()
                      host = host,
                      port = port,
                      user = user,
                      password = password,
                      dbname = dbname)
